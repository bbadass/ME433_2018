Things to do:
1: Ground the Pololu USB mini-B  
2: Ground the MCP1702 voltage regulator
3: Connect the IN of the voltage regulator to the Pololu USB OUT
4: Connect the OUT of the voltage regulator to provide 3.3V power to the + rail of the breadboard
5: Connect an LED to the 3.3V rail of the breadboard in series with a 330 Ohm resistor between the LED and ground
6: Measure the current on the breadboard rails with an oscillator and take a picture
7: Connect a 10 micro Farad capactor in parallel between the ground and OUT of the voltage regulator
8: Connect a 1 micro Farad capactior in parallel between the ground and IN of the voltage regulator 
9: Keep measuring the signal with an oscillator and report wavechanges -> The signal has lower amplitude oscillatiosn when the diode is inserted, and the oscillatios go away when the 10uF capacitor is inserted, the 1uF (which in this case is 0.1uF) capacitor does not make a difference in the signal.
