Things to do:
1: Ground the Pololu USB mini-B  
2: Ground the MCP1702 voltage regulator
3: Connect the IN of the voltage regulator to the Pololu USB OUT
4: Connect the OUT of the voltage regulator to provide 3.3V power to the + rail of the breadboard
5: Connect an LED to the 3.3V rail of the breadboard in series with a 330 Ohm resistor between the LED and ground
6: Measure the current on the breadboard rails with an oscillator and take a picture
7: Connect a 10 micro Farad capactor in parallel between the ground and OUT of the voltage regulator
8: Connect a 1 micro Farad capactior in parallel between the ground and IN of the voltage regulator 
9: Keep measuring the signal with an oscillator and report wavechanges
10: Turn the power off
11: Connect the PIC32's VCAP to ground, in series with a 10 micro Farad capacitor
