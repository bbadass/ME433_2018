Things to do:
1: Ground the Pololu USB mini-B  
2: Ground the MCP1702 voltage regulator
3: Connect the IN of the voltage regulator to the Pololu USB OUT
4: Connect the OUT of the voltage regulator to provide 3.3V power to the + rail of the breadboard
5: Connect an LED to the 3.3V rail of the breadboard in series with a 330 Ohm resistor between the LED and ground
6: Measure the current on the breadboard rails with an oscillator and take a picture
7: Connect a 10 micro Farad capactor in parallel between the ground and OUT of the voltage regulator
8: Connect a 1 micro Farad capactior in parallel between the ground and IN of the voltage regulator 
9: Keep measuring the signal with an oscillator and report wavechanges -> The signal has lower amplitude oscillatiosn when the diode is inserted, and the oscillatios go away when the 10uF capacitor is inserted, the 1uF (which in this case is 0.1uF) capacitor does not make a difference in the signal.
10: Turn the power off
11: Connect the PIC32's VCAP (pin 20) to ground, in series with a 10 micro Farad capacitor
12: Connect the PIC32's MLR (pin 1) to the ICSP's pin 1
13: Connect the PIC32's VDD pins to 3.3V (pin 13, 28)
14: Connect the PIC32's VSS, AVDD and AVSS pins to ground (pin 8, 27)
15: Connect a 0.1uF capacitor between VDD and VSS pairs (pins 27 and 28) 
16: Connect an LED to the PIC32's A4 (pin 12), in series with a 300 Ohm resistor
17: Connect the PIC32's PGED1 pin (pin 4) to pin 5 in the ICSP 
18: Connect the PIC32's PGEC1 pin (pin 5) to pin 4 in the ICSP
19: Connect pin 3 in the ICSP to ground
20: Connect pin 2 in the ICSP to 3.3V
21: Connect pin 1 in the ICSP to 3.3V in series with a 10kOhm resistor
22: Connect the PIC32's MLR (pin 1) to a reset button connected to ground
23: Connect the PIC32's OSC1 (pin 9) to one of the outer pins of the resonator
24: Connect the PIC32's OSC2 (pin 10) to the other outer pin of the resonator
25: Connect the middle pin of the resonator to ground
26: Connect the PIC32's VBUS pin (pin 15) to 5V
27: Connect the PIC2's VUSB3V3 pin (pin 23) to 3.3V
28: Connect the PIC32's D+ pin (pin 21) to the Poulou USB D+ pin
29: Connect the PIC32's D- pin (pin 22) to the Poulou USB D- pin
30: Connect the PIC32's B4 pin (pin ) to a push button in series with a 10kOhm resistor connected to 3.3V, and with the other end connected to ground
31: Verify a clear signal -> Verified
